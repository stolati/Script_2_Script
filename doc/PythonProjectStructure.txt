- Name the directory something related to your project
  - when releases, add a number version ( like Twisted-2.5 )
- Create a directory "bin" and put executables, don't give extentions on it (.py or .bash)
  - don't put any code, except import and some main functions
- Create a directory with the name of the project ( twisted ), and put your code here
  - Create in it a package for the unittest (Twisted/twisted/test)
- add a readme : "README", a setup.py to explain install
